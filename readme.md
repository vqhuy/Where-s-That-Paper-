# Where's That Paper - Firefox version

### What is the repository?

This is a Firefox port of the Chrome extension ["Where's that
paper?"](https://github.com/eylonyogev/Where-s-That-Paper-) by [Eylon
Yogev](https://www.eylonyogev.com/about). 

It contains some bug fixes. A major change is it **only** adds the current
viewing academic papers to a _Repository_ folder in your Bookmark Toolbar, when
you click the extensionâ€™s icon.
